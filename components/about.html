<h2>What does {EXTITLE} do?</h2><p>This extension was built to remove those annoying cookie consent notices, banners and warnings that pop all over the web. It will not give any consent to advertising cookies, nor will it alter cookie behaviour—it just blocks or closes in-page notifications so you don't have to. As such, it's important to note that blocking these notices is <span style="font-weight:700">not</span> a guarantee that websites won't set any cookies to track you. Furthermore, some websites are particularly forceful in their implementations of cookie consent, so this extension may not work in all cases. It'll work in a lot of them though!!</p><p>{EXTITLE} works by injecting scripts into each tab. These scripts use a multitude of techniques to block a wide variety of cookie notices, and each script can be enabled/disabled at your discretion. A core aim of this project was to achieve intelligent blocking without any noticeable impact on computer performance. For example, scripts will only run in the active tab and are throttled if they take a while to execute.</p><p>You can disable blocking on individual websites by using the whitelist feature. An open tab's domain can be quickly whitelisted by clicking on the {EXTITLE} button in the Chrome toolbar—the required field in the options page will be filled in automatically. Just one more click and the domain will be whitelisted.</p><p>Any changes made to the settings will be instantly reflected in your open tabs. All settings will be synced automatically to your Chrome profile.</p><p>{EXTITLE} does not rely on any third-party ad-block database. The filters and algorithms developed for this extension are all a result of my own tests and experiments. Basically, I'm the guy to blame if it doesn't work. On that note: if you have any questions, feature requests or bugs you'd like to report, feel free to <a class="exsupport" target="_blank">leave a comment on the Chrome web store page</a>.</p><h2>About the developer</h2><div id="profilepadding" style="user-select:none"><img id="profile" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1112492902771556357/bYUMSoKP_200x200.png"></div><p>My name is Ben and I work as a front-end web developer in the UK. I first developed an interest in web development after my first year at the University of East Anglia, studying Computer Science. Once I discovered the wonderful thing that is the Chrome Extension API, I became addicted to making and using Chrome extensions.</p><p>I aim to make my Chrome projects the very best solutions available on the web store, both in their functionality and efficiency. I don't want my software to be unnecessarily taxing on your computer, so I avoid incorporating resource-hogging background processes as much as possible. I also take care in using the minimum amount of permissions necessary for my extensions to function.</p><p>I'm passionate about being creative in all of my work, and always strive to try new things and better myself. This extension is one of many projects of mine.</p><div style="left:50%;transform:translate(-50%);position:relative;margin-bottom:25px;font-size:12pt;text-align:center;display:block"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bencheshire">Find me on LinkedIn</a> • <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/benchesh">Follow me on Twitter</a> • <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/benchesh">Subscribe to my YouTube channel</a></div><h3>Donate</h3><p>I am very grateful for any donations made to me.
